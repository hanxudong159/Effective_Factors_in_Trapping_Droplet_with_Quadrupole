# Effective Factors in Trapping Droplet with Quadrupole

Electro-dynamic balance (EDB) is widely used in mass spectrometry, control of charged micro droplet and other study. By EDB, an electrodynamic balance levitation system with linear quadrupole is developed. Considering the lifetime of the droplet, the response time in trapping the droplet is important, which could be controlled by AC voltage and frequency. And for evaporation of the droplet, parameters should be controlled to make the droplet trapped successfully. As the effective coverage of the quadrupole is limit, the initial velocity of the droplet should be considered to insure the motion inside the limit coverage.
